# icrawler

Simple Python-based web crawler that downloads PDF files and converts web
pages to PDF. Provide seed URLs and the crawler will follow links on those
pages, downloading linked PDFs or rendering HTML pages to PDF files.

## Usage

```
python -m icrawler.crawler [--delay N] [--jitter M] <output_dir> <url1> [<url2> ...]
```

`--delay` specifies a minimum pause (in seconds) between HTTP requests while
`--jitter` adds a random extra wait time up to the given value. This helps
avoid hitting remote servers too aggressively.

See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
